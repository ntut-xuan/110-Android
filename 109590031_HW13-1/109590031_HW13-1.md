### **Question 1**

In which lifecycle method do you save the app state to shared preferences?



### Answer

`onPause()`



### **Question 2**

In which lifecycle method do you restore the app state?



### Answer

`onCreate()`



### **Question 3**

Can you think of a case where it makes sense to have both shared preferences and instance state?



### Answer

`Login page` to store username and password in shared preferences, avoid to retype username and password when you reset application.

Save username to instance state if you want to reuse it in next activity.
